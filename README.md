Welcome to my GitHub profile page!

I'm Jiheon Kim (@wlgjs678).

# Note
I've published a multiple of projects I've done over the last two years at Montgomery College (Germantown) and one year and a half at University of Maryland (College Park).
There are also personal projects published separately.

# About Me
I am currently enrolled at UMD (College Park) as an undergraduate and am planning to graduate in 2023 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

How I chose computer science:

I discovered that I am interested in computer science while I was exploring various fields of studies at a community college (Montgomery College). I then set my academic goals related to computer science. I graduated from the community college with an Associate's Degree in Compupter Science and transferred to UMD (University of Maryland).
I am now aiming to receive a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and am pursuing my career to become a software engineer.
