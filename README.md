# Welcome to my GitHub profile page!

I'm Jiheon Kim (@wlgjs678).

## Note
I've published multiples of projects I've done over the last two years at Montgomery College (Germantown) and another two years at the University of Maryland (College Park); there are also personal projects published separately.

## About Me
I'm currently enrolled at UMD (College Park) as an undergraduate and am planning to graduate in Dec. 2023 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

- How I chose computer science:

I discovered that I'm interested in computer science while I was exploring various fields of studies at the community college. I found it facinating that I can contribute to various types of industries and societies with the knowledge and skills from computer science. Then, I set my academic goals related to computer science. I graduated from the community college with an Associate's Degree in Compupter Science and transferred to the University of Maryland to study more in depth.

I'm now aiming to receive a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science by Dec. 2023 and am pursuing my career to become a software engineer.
Currently, I'm also working at SociableAI as a backend developer to expand my skills and adapt to a working environment. I started this job in Feb. 2023.


- What I like:

I like spending time with my friends and family, ATV riding, Kayaking, watching movies/dramas, playing video games, billiards, legos, and many more!
