# Welcome to my GitHub profile page!

I'm Jiheon Kim (@wlgjs678).

## Note
I've published multiple projects I've done over the last two years at Montgomery College (Germantown) and three years at the University of Maryland (College Park); there are also personal projects published separately.

## About Me
I'm a recent graduate from UMD (College Park) with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science; I graduated in May 2024.

I've worked at Sociable AI as a full-stack developer to expand my skills  with hands-on experience and adapt to a working environment for over a year. Now, I'm taking the next step to become a better software engineer.

- How I chose computer science:

I discovered that I'm interested in computer science while I was exploring various fields of study at the community college. I found it fascinating that I can contribute to various types of industries and societies with the knowledge and skills of computer science. Then, I set my academic goals related to computer science. I graduated from the community college with an Associate's Degree in Computer Science and transferred to the University of Maryland to study more in-depth.

- What I like:

I like spending time with my friends and family, ATV riding, Kayaking, watching movies/dramas, playing video games, billiards, legos, and many more!
